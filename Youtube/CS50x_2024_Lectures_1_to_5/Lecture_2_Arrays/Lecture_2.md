# Lecture 2

## Compiling

- Make: Run an compiler.

- Clang: As make, but not as user friendly.

- CLA(Command line arguments): Words that modify the behavior o a program.

- Third-party library: in clang and other must be add an extra command.

- Preprocessing: Find and replace, read the code and convert the # 

- .h: Are prototypes as when use our own function

- Compiling: Convert source code into assembly code(An programming language).

- Assembling: Take te compiled code and convert it to 0 and 1.

- Linking: Search .h files to get the code used.

- Decompiling: Going from assembly code to source code.

## Debugging

- Grace Hopper: Popularized the prase "bug"(mistake in a computer code) 
  a moth got stock in a relay.

- In c before initializing a variable with a value it often content a "garbage value".

- Rubber duck debugging: Talk to a duck to debug code(sound crazy but it does work).

## Memory

- *bool*: 1 byte.

- *int*: 4 bytes.

- *long*: 8 bytes.

- *float*: 4 bytes.

- *double*: 8 bytes.

- *char*: 1 byte.

- *string*: ? bytes depends on the text.

- RAM: Store the bytes of info, we can take memory as having addresses.

## Arrays

- Sequence of values, chunk of memory storing values, back to back.

- int scores[3] = How to declare an array for 3 int values.

- scores[0] = #; = How to give a value to an array index. 

## Strings

- Char use '' not "".

- Chars and Ints, can be treated the same if bits to fit one in the other. 

- Strings: Sequence of characters from left to right.

- Computer know that strings ends with an sentinel value(0000000) made long time ago.

- String use 1 extra byte for the sentinel value.

## Command-line Arguments

- Use the terminal to complement the code, just with codes as rm, but to also get,
  values for the code.

## Exit status

- Special return value from the program default 0.

- In code can be used for problems in code.

- echo%?: Most recently-run program secretly exit with. 

## Cryptography

- Art and science of encrypting, scrambling information.

- Plaintext: The message it self in any language.

- Cipher: Algorithm for encrypting the plaintext.

- Ciphertext: The plaintext encrypted with the cipher.

- Key: A way to decode te ciphertext with a "key" on how to decode it.

- Decryption: The way of decrypting the code.
