# Lecture 5

## Stacks and Queues

- *Data structures*: Way of structure data.

- In C, how to use the computer memory to solve problems more effectively.

- Abstract data types: Data structure but offer some caracteristics ans is up to
  the programmer how to implement it.

- *Queues*: Basicly what we know as lines.

- *FIFO*: First in first out, used in queues.

- *enqueue*: Enter the queue.

- *dequeue*: Exit the queue.

- *stacks*: Omnipresent as well, but follow diferent as FIFO.

- *LIFO*: Last in first out, used in stacks, used in emails.

- *push*: push into the stack.

- *pop*: Take out of the stack.

## Resizing Arrays

- Arrays can be resized, but it uses more memory and time in code.

- list.c

- Essentialy uses pointer arithmetic using malloc.
