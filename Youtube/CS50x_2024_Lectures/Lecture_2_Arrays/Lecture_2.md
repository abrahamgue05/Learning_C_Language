# Lecture 2

## Compiling

- Make: Run an compililer.

- Clang: As make, but not as user friendly.

- CLA(Command line arguments): Words that modify the behavior o a program.

- Third-party library: in clang and other must be add an extra command.

- Preprocessing: Find and replace, read the code and convert the # 

- .h: Are prototipes as when use our own function

- Compiling: Convert source code into assembly code(An programming language).

- Assembling: Take te compiled code and convert it to 0 and 1.

- Linking: Serch .h files to get the code used.

- Decompiling: Going from assembly code to source code.

## Debugging

- Grace Hopper: Popularized the prase "bug"(mistake in a computer code) 
  a moth got stock in a relay.

- In c before initializing a variable with a value it often content a "garbage value".

- Rubber duck debugging: Talk to a duck to debug code(sound crazy but it does work).
