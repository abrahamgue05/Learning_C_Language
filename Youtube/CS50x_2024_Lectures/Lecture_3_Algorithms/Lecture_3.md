# Lecture 3

## Overview

- Learn how to think algorithmically.

- Learn how to use all learned in lecture 1 and 2.

## Linear Search

- A computer can only look at one value at the time in an array.

- Inpunt: An array of numbers.

- Algorithm: A way to find the number or data in the array. 

- bool: Is an expecific number like 50, true or false.

- Going to one end of the array to another, left to right or right to left.

## Binary Search

- Divide and conquer, take on half of the array, and keep dividing until the value
  is found.

## Running Time

- O: Big O notation, upper bound on the number of step.

- n: Number of things in a problem, people for example.

- *O(n^2)*: Cuadratic, n people doing n thing.

- *O(n log n)*: n log n.

- *O(n)*: Linear time, goes one by one,Linar search.

- *O(log n)*: Logarithmic.

- *O(1)*: Constant, faster, a constant number of step.
