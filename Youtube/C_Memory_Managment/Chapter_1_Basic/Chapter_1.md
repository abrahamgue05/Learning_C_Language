# Chapter 1

- ***Interpreted***: Python, JS, run and executed JIT(Just in time).

- ***Compiled***: C, Go, The compiler checks the type sistem.

- Not always, but compiled are faster than interpreted.

- *Cons of compiled*: Can take long time to compile, most compleat all erros.

- In C a data type can't be change to another data type.

- The ++ or -- before the variable means that it does the operation and then it 
  gives the value to the variable and the -- or ++ is gives the value and then the
  operation.

- The ternary operator can be asigned to a variable.

- ***#pragma once***: Adding this line to the top of a feader file tells the 
  compiler to include the file only once, even if it's referenced multiple times.

- ***header guards***: Works by defining a unique macro for the header file. If 
  it's already been included, the guard prevents if from being processed again.
