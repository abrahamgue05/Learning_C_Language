# Chapter 7

- An address that points to another address.

- Are like treasure map or a scavenger hunt, start at one pointer and keep
  following the chain of addresses until the final value is met.

- Allows to make complex data structures like arrays of pointers and modify
  pointers directly.

- *void(argument):* Means that the function returns nothing.

- *int function(void):* Means the functions takes no argument.

- *void(star)*: "void pointer" tells the compiler that this pointer could point
  to **anything**.

- This is why void pointer are also know as a "generic pointer". Since void
  pointers do not have an specific data type.
