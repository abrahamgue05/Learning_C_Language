# Chapter 3

- ***Variables***: Human readable names that refer to some data in memory.

- ***Memory***: Big array of bytes, and data is stored in a array.

- In C, the address of a variable can be printed using the address operator '&'.

- Is literally just a number, written in hex.

- The code probably doesn't give direct access to te physical RAM in the computer,
  instead, the S.O. provides a layer of abstraction called virtual memory.

- If someone tells you pointers are hats, is just skill issue.

- ***Pointes***: A value that tells the address of another value.

- When given the value of an other variable it just gibe the same value, not the
  address.

- To give the exact address it will be *int *xptr = &x;*.

- Compiler lose the size of an Array when is casted into a pointer, that 
  information is lost.
