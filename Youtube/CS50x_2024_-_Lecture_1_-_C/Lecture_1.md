# Lecture 1

## Machine code

- Learn how to solve problems with *functions*, *variables*, *conditionals*,
  *loops* and more.

- Learn how (not) to solve probles.

- Source code: What we write.

- Machine code: What computer speaks.

- Source code --> Compiler --> Machine code.

- Compiler: Program that translates one languaje to another.

## Visual Studio Code for CS50

- VSCODE: Free, popular, compiler.

- Tabbed interface: Where we write code.

- Terminal: Console, where we type comands, for compiling a code, for running code.

- Folder interface: Where files or folders we create are going to end up.

- Activity: Vs CODE-specific features.

## From scratch to C

- Functions: Implimatiation in code of algorithms, step by step instruction
  for solving problems.

- Arguments: Inputs to functions in some context parameters.

- Side effects: Sometimes functions have them.

- Escape sequences: \n.
