# Lecture 1

## Machine code

- Learn how to solve problems with *functions*, *variables*, *conditionals*,
  *loops* and more.

- Learn how (not) to solve probles.

- Source code: What we write.

- Machine code: What computer speaks.

- Source code --> Compiler --> Machine code.

- Compiler: Program that translates one languaje to another.

## Visual Studio Code for CS50

- VSCODE: Free, popular, compiler.

- Tabbed interface: Where we write code.

- Terminal: Console, where we type comands, for compiling a code, for running code.

- Folder interface: Where files or folders we create are going to end up.

- Activity: Vs CODE-specific features.

## From scratch to C

- Functions: Implimatiation in code of algorithms, step by step instruction
  for solving problems.

- Arguments: Inputs to functions in some context parameters.

- Side effects: Sometimes functions have them.

- Escape sequences: \n.

## CS50 Library

- #include <stdio.h>: A lot of functionalities come in separete files,
like printf();.

- header file: Represent a library(code that someone else wrote) 
like #include <stdio.h>.

- Manual pages: Documentation of how somethings work in code https://manual.cs50.io.

- cs50.h: Library made by cs50 https://manual.cs50.io.h(Documentation).

- Return value: Return a value for you to use it how ever you want.

## Format code

- Functions work as you past an argument, and for a second argument 
goes after a coma(,).

## Types

- Types of data:  bool, char, double, float, int, long, string ...

- Format codes: %c, %f, %i, %li, %s.
