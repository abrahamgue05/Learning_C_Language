## Welcome to class

- ### Topics

- Overview of C - Efficient, portable, power and flexibility, programmer oriented.

- Language features - Imperative language, top-down planning, structured 
  programming.

- Advantages of using C - Small, fast progras, reliable, easy to learn and 
  understand.

- How to use a moder, cross-platafor IDE to write, edit and debug your C code.

- Basic C concepts - Structure of a program, comments, output using printf,
  "Hello world".

- Makefiles - How to build.

- Variables - Declaring and using variables.

- Data types - int, float, double, char, etc (as well as enums and type 
  definitions).

- Basic Operators - Logical, arithmethic and assignment.

- Conditional Statement - Making decision (if, switch).

- Repeating code - Looping (for, while and do-while).

- Arrays - Defining and initializing, multi-dimensional.

- Functions - Declaration and use, arguments and parameters, 
  call by values vs call by reference.

- Debbuging - Call stack, common mistakes, understanding compiler messages.

- Structs - Initializing, nested strcuctures, variants.

- Character Strings - Basic, arrays of char, character operation.

- Pointes - Definition and use, using with functions and arrays, malloc, 
  pointer arithmetic.

- The Preproccesor - #define, #include.

- Input and Output - getchar, scanf.

- File Input/Output - Reading and writing to a file, file operations.

- Standard C Library - Strings functions, math functions, utility functions, 
  standard header.

- ### Course Outcomes
 
- Being able to write begginer C programs.

- Being able to write efficient, high quality C code (modular/ low coupling).

- Being able to find and fix your erros (understand compiler messages).

- You will understand fundamental aspects of the C Programming language.
