# Section 1

## Welcome to class

- ### Topics

  - *Overview of C* - Efficient, portable, power and flexibility, 
    programmer oriented.

  - *Language features* - Imperative language, top-down planning, structured 
    programming.

  - *Advantages of using C* - Small, fast progras, reliable, easy to learn and 
    understand.

  - How to use a moder, cross-platafor IDE to write, edit and debug your C code.

  - *Basic C concepts* - Structure of a program, comments, output using printf,
    "Hello world".

  - *Makefiles* - How to build.

  - *Variables* - Declaring and using variables.

  - *Data types* - int, float, double, char, etc (as well as enums and type
    definitions).

  - *Basic Operators* - Logical, arithmethic and assignment.

  - *Conditional Statement* - Making decision (if, switch).

  - *Repeating code* - Looping (for, while and do-while).

  - *Arrays* - Defining and initializing, multi-dimensional.

  - *Functions* - Declaration and use, arguments and parameters, 
    call by values vs call by reference.

  - *Debbuging* - Call stack, common mistakes, understanding compiler messages.

  - *Structs* - Initializing, nested strcuctures, variants.

  - *Character Strings* - Basic, arrays of char, character operation.

  - *Pointes* - Definition and use, using with functions and arrays, malloc, 
    pointer arithmetic.

  - *The Preproccesor* - #define, #include.

  - *Input and Output* - getchar, scanf.

  - *File Input/Output* - Reading and writing to a file, file operations.

  - *Standard C Library* - Strings functions, math functions, utility functions, 
    standard header.

- ### Course Outcomes
 
  - Being able to write begginer C programs.

  - Being able to write efficient, high quality C code (modular/ low coupling).

  - Being able to find and fix your erros (understand compiler messages).

  - You will understand fundamental aspects of the C Programming language.

## Class Organization

- Explaning the why and providing the how.

- Demostrations of code.

- Challenges (coding assignment/projects).

## Fundamentals of a programm

- Computer only do what they are told to do with and algorithm expressed in the 
  statement of a particular computer language.

- *CPU*: Central processing unit, doest most of the work, 
  instructions are executed here.

- *RAM*: Random access memory, stores data of a program while it is running.

- *Hard drive*: Permanent storage, store the files that contaub program source
  code.

- *Operating System*: Make it easier to use a computer, 
  controls the entire operation of a computer , Windows, Unix, Android, etc.

- *Fetch/Execute Cycle(Life of a cpu)*: fetches an instruction from memory
  and executes it.

- High-level programming languages, make it easier to write programs.

- *Compiler*: A program that translate the code into machine code,
  cheking also if there is any syntax problems.

- ### Steps in writing a program

  - 1.- Define the program: Getting a clear idea of what the code must do.

  - 2.- Desing: Desing the interface and program Organization.

  - 3.- Write code: Create the code.

  - 4.- Compile.

  - 5.- Run the program.

  - 6.- Test and debug: Test the program to see if it works correctly.

  - 7.- Maintain and modify the program: Fix bugs and add features.
  
## Overview

- C is a general-porpouse, imperative computer programming language that supports
  structured programming.

- Can change a program's state, focused on how.

- C is a modern language, has basic structures and features of modern language,
  modular desing, reliable and readable.

- Used in minicomputers, systemas and mainframes.

- Strong role in the development of Linux.

- C is a subset of C++ with OOP.

- Avilable for most computers and is also hardware independent.
