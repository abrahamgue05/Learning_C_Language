# Section 9

## Functions

- A self-contained unit of program code designed to accomplish a particular task.

- Sythax rules define the structure of a function and how it can be used.

- A function in C is the same as subroutines or procedures in other programming 
  languages.

- Some functions cause an action to take place, printf(causes data to be printed 
  on) your screen, others can find a value for a program to use strlen(tells a 
  program how long is a string).

  <summary>Advantages</summary>
    
    - Allows the divide and conquer strategy, tasks can be divided into several 
    independent substacks, reducing over all complexity.

    - Reduce duplication of code, time, writing, testing and debbuging.

    - A task that is repeated several times can be done with a function.

    - Helps with readability and organization.

    - Reduce the overall development time.

    - Funtions can be reused not only in that program, but in other too.
