<summary>Expressions and Statements</summary>

- ***Statemets***: Building blocks of a program, most statements are constructed 
  from expression.

    - A program is a series of statements with speacil syntax ending with a 
    semicolon.

    - *Declaration Statemets*: int Abraham;

    - *Assingment Statements*: Abraham = 5;

    - *Function call statement*: printf("Abraham");

    - *Return Statement*: return 0;

    - **Compound Statements**: Two or more statements grouped togheter by 
    enclosing them in braces(block). 

- ***Expressions***: Consists of a combination of operators and operands, always have
  values.

    - Operands are what an operator compares on.

    - Operands can be constans, variables, or combinats.

    - *Examples*: -6, 4 + 21, q = 5 * 2, q > 3
