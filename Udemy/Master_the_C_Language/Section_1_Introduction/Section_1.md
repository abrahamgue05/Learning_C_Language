## Class Organization

- Explaning the why and providing the how.

- Demostrations of code.

- Challenges (coding assignment/projects).

## Fundamentals of a programm

- Computer only do what they are told to do with and algorithm expressed in the
  statement of a particular computer language.

- *CPU*: Central processing unit, doest most of the work,
  instructions are executed here.

- *RAM*: Random access memory, stores data of a program while it is running.

- *Hard drive*: Permanent storage, store the files that contaub program source
  code.

- *Operating System*: Make it easier to use a computer,
  controls the entire operation of a computer , Windows, Unix, Android, etc.

- *Fetch/Execute Cycle(Life of a cpu)*: fetches an instruction from memory
  and executes it.

- High-level programming languages, make it easier to write programs.

- *Compiler*: A program that translate the code into machine code,
  cheking also if there is any syntax problems.

- ### Steps in writing a program

  - 1.- Define the program: Getting a clear idea of what the code must do.

  - 2.- Desing: Desing the interface and program Organization.

  - 3.- Write code: Create the code.

  - 4.- Compile.

  - 5.- Run the program.

  - 6.- Test and debug: Test the program to see if it works correctly.

  - 7.- Maintain and modify the program: Fix bugs and add features.

## Overview

- C is a general-porpouse, imperative computer programming language that supports
  structured programming.

- Can change a program's state, focused on how.

- C is a modern language, has basic structures and features of modern language,
  modular desing, reliable and readable.

- Used in minicomputers, systemas and mainframes.

- Strong role in the development of Linux.

- C is a subset of C++ with OOP.

- Avilable for most computers and is also hardware independent.


## Language Features

- Compact and efficient programs.

- One of the most important programming languages.

- *Efficient*: Takes advantage of the capabilities of the computers,
  compact and fast, programmers can fine-tune programs.

- *Portable*: C programs written on one system can be run on other systems with
  no modifications.

- *Compiler*: Compailers are avilable for PC, in Linux they come as part of the
  package.

- *Poweful and flexible*: Unix/Linux Kernel is written in C, some compilers are
  written in C.

- *Programmer Oriented*: Gives accest to hardware, can manipulate individual bits
  less strict than most languages in limiting what can be done.

- Provides low level features, can manipulate bits, pointes.

- *Disadvantages*: More responsability needed, sometimes is dificult to read.

## Creating a C Program

- *Editing*: Proccess of creating and modifying C code.

- *Compiling*: Converts the source code into machine code and detect
  and reports errors of syntax and semantics of the language C in this case.

- *Linking*: Get the program into a final form for execution on the computer,
  in some system is run automatically when compiled.

- *Executing*: Success will produce a executable file automatically,
  this can also cause problems(wrong output, crashing, etc.).
