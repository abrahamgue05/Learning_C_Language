# Section 4

## Comments

- Used in program to document a program to enhance its readability.

- Remainder of what the program does or what a line of code is doing.

- Ignored by the compailer.

- Very useful as they can remind the purpose of the code even after months
  later, save time reading and undestanding a code.

- *Multi line comment*: Start with /* and must be terminated with */.

- *Single line comment*: Only open with // and what is after them in the same
  line of code is a comment.

- There is no limit of comments, but it can also degrade the readability of 
  a program if not used intelligently.

- Not everything needs to be a comment using meaninful names in variables
  and functions works to.
