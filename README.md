# Learning C Programming 💻

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my journey of learning the **C programming language**. The goal is simple: learn, experiment, and share my progress.

## 🛠️ Tools I'm Using
- **IDE/Editor**: VS code
- **Compiler**: GCC 
- **OS**: Windows
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub to track and share my progress.

## 📚 Resources I'm Using

>[!NOTE]
>Here are some important things I've learned along the way:

- C file names can't have spaces or special characters.  
  ❌ Hello World.c  
  ✔ Hello_world.c / helloworld.c

- When we want to run a C program:</br>
  1️⃣ **Compile**: Converts the C into machine code using a compiler.</br>
  2️⃣ **Run**: Execute the compiled machine code.


I’ll keep adding more as I progress!
