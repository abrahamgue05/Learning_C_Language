# Learning C Programming üíª

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my journey of learning the **C programming language**. The goal is simple: learn, experiment, and share my progress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools I'm Using
- **IDE/Editor**: VS code
- **Compiler**: GCC 
- **OS**: Linux
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub to track and share my progress.

## üìö Resources I'm Using

Here are the platforms and materials I'm using to learn C programming:

### üé• YouTube

- [x] [C Programming Tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
  This course will give you a full introduction into all of the core concepts in the C programming language.

- [x] [CS50x 2024 - Lecture 1 to 5 - C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwtpLIWylAw&t=1233s&ab_channel=CS50)
  This is CS50, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

- [ ] [C programming and Memory Managment](https://youtu.be/rJrd2QMVbGM?si=mdqOehm_f8hkgadX) 
  Learn how to manually manage memory in the C programming language and build not one, but two garbage collectors from scratch! If you're used to working with languages and tools that handle it for you, this course will teach you how all that works under the hood.

### üìò Udemy

>[!NOTE]
>Udemy is with a scholarship, so i have a limit of time(Feb 28).

- [ ] [C programming For beginners - Master the C Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/?couponCode=ST18MT12125AROW) c-programming-for-beginners-/. - C Programming will increase career options. Become a better dev in other languages by learning C. Pointers explained. 

### Projects

- [ ] [Snake game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShlJel8gOeU&ab_channel=CompleteCodingbyPrashantSir)
  The famous snake game.

- [ ] [Bank managment system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bank-account-system-in-c-using-file-handling/)
  Using some already existing videos and code sheets I will make my own bank system.

**Note**: All code examples and projects are written in **English**.

## üìù What's This About?
This repository is a space for:
- Keep a record and a track of what I learn
- Practicing fundamental and advanced C programming concepts.
- Sharing insights and resources for anyone interested in my own chosen path.

## üîç What's Coming Next?
- Mini projects to apply concepts.
- Solutions to coding challenges.
- A growing list of helpful resources and tools.

Stay tuned as I dive deeper into the world of C programming!

>[!NOTE]
>Here are some important things I've learned along the way:

- C file names can't have spaces or special characters.  
  ‚ùå Hello World.c  
  ‚úî Hello_world.c / helloworld.c

- When we want to run a C program:</br>
  1Ô∏è‚É£ **Compile**: Converts the C into machine code using a compiler.</br>
  2Ô∏è‚É£ **Run**: Execute the compiled machine code.


I‚Äôll keep adding more as I progress!
