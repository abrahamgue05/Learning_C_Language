It is said that the best way to learn is through practice, which is exactly what 
this section is for. Here, I will be working on various projects, such as:

## GUI Calculator

- **Why:** School homework.

- **How:** YouTube videos due to the lack of time.

- **Tools:** ```libclipboard```.

## Bank system 

- **Why:** A way to practice data structures

- **How:** Mostly by hand, but the basic structure by Internet or YouTube

- **Tools:** Basic .h files
