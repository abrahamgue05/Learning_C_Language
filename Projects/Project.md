# Projects

It is said that the best way to learn is through practice, which is exactly what 
this section is for. Here, I will be working on various projects, such as:

## GUI Calculator

- **Why:** School homework.

- **How:** YouTube videos due to the lack of time.

- **Tools:** To see.

## Bank system 

- **Why:** A way to practice data structures

- **How:** Mostly by hand, but the basic structure by Internet or YouTube

- **Tools:** Basic .h files

## Snake Game

- **Why?:** It's a game who doesn't love games, something like a snake or mine searcher

- **How?:** Videos or by hand depending on the game

- **Tools:** Required libraries

## Extras

- I want to do computer memory related programs.

- **Why?:** C is a memory language, learning malloc and more related memory things as pointers and addresses

- **How?:** Videos or web ideas mostly

- **Tools:** The necessary libraries

- Those are the ones I have planned until now, and I don't think of doing more

- The next step is C++ programming language
